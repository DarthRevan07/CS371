# CS371
Lightweight implementation of ProGAP model for differential privacy on network data.

## What's what : 

(i) `data_EDA` : Jupyter notebook containing certain exploratory data analytics statistics and plots for one of the member datasets used - the `Facebook` dataset. 

(ii) `differential_privacy_fb100_reddit` : Jupyter notebook consisting of data pre-processing, and 2 different kinds of baselines for node classification comparison. The actual ProGAP model is also trained and tested for accuracy on training, testing and validation sets. The plot for accuracy vs varying epsilon values has been plotted. 2 dataset results present.

(iii) `differential_privacy_fb` : Similar Jupyter notebook, contains results for the `Facebook` dataset.
